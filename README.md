# Summary 

My solutions to the exercises in the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python ([ISLP](https://www.statlearning.com/)).

I attempt to tackle both conceptual and applied exercises in these notebooks.


## Notes:
- Questions that involve sketching are done using matplotlib's `xkcd` theme.
- Mathematical proofs are mostly written using mathjax inside the markdown cells by wrapping the mathjax code in `$...$` like so $\alpha^2 + \beta_0 = \gamma$, though some were updated to use LaTeX align environments to be compatible with jupyter-book.
- I typed the questions in the notebooks for chapters `2` and `3`, but it was taking too much time so I stopped doing that from chapter `4` and on.
