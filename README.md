# ISLP Solutions

Jupyter Notebook solutions to the exercises in the book Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python ([ISLP](https://www.statlearning.com/)).

I attempt to tackle both conceptual and applied exercises in these notebooks.

## Notes:
- Questions that involve sketching are done using matplotlib's `xkcd` theme.
- Mathematical proofs are written using mathjax inside the markdown cells by wrapping the mathjax code in `$...$` like so $\alpha^2 + \beta_0 = \gamma$ 

## TODO
- Finish the remaining chapters
- Make the notebooks available on Binder or Google Colab.
- Use some tool (e.g. jupyterbook) to create a website that has all the notebooks displayed cleanly.
